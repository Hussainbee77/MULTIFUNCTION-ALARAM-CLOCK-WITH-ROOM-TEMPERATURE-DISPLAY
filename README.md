# MULTIFUNCTION-ALARAM-CLOCK-WITH-ROOM-TEMPERATURE-DISPLAY
This embedded system displays real-time clock data and room temperature on an LCD using RTC and LM35. It includes an alarm that activates a buzzer and can be stopped manually or after a timeout. A dedicated interrupt button opens a menu via keypad to edit RTC settings or set alarm time with input validation for reliable operation.
